bug if mepc happens at 0, doesn't trap #TODO

- Handle interrupt posting in controller (To verify)
- Include vectored trapping through mtvec (make implementation through software)
- Include return from trap instructions (TODO)
- implement context switching (TODO)

- Add multiplication support

Idea to demonstrate trap capabilities:
- introduce some trap table with an timer interrupt and standard exception implemented
- do some basic computations and wait for a trap in timecmp
- trap and write some stuff into memory, return from trap
- read that memory, and trap again by misaligned address
- trap and write something into memory before returning


1. Write to mtvec
2. Write to timer time_compare
3. enable machine global interrupt
4. enable machine time interrupt 
3. Do nothing and wait for the interrupt
4. add some number to the register, and return

Current issues:
- after trapping, csrs get muddled and mepc gets lost, fix this
- Context switch must be done
